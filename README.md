# Finance-app
This app is named financify and was used for my final year project. The purpose of the app is to help users with their personal finances by managing their expenses and giving them detailed investment data in stock market.

The Application was implemented in Android Studio Java and utilized Firebase as a cloud-based database.

The main API's used were yahoofinanceapi and alphavantage. For visual graphics, I used CanvasJS to implement the live price features and display comparisions of different metrics across financial statments.

Main Features:
* Expense Management
* Stock Portfolio Management
* Investment Analysis
* Real-time price alert system
